echelon
===========
originaly from:
https://github.com/gen0cide-/echelon

i saw this nice server and modified it to be more easy to use but still not everything tested.

the seturl works 100%

but the addheader and setheader are not fully tested yet.

still havn't got the time to look on the resmod method yet so it just for requests.

will be added option for some db this or another.

will be added the option to use an advaced request and response urls to match crytiria and apply different actions.

problem that are known:
the OPTIONS icap response is not fullty built so squid will show some warnings.

When you are ready, simply `ruby echelon.rb config/settings.yml`
or to deamonize `ruby echelon.rb config/settings.yml&`
